Upgrade and Compatibility
-------------------------
In this section, we only highlight a few significant changes in this SDK.  For full list of upgrade and
compatibility topics, please refer to individual components release notes :ref:`sdk_components`.

Gateway Demos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Gateway Demos are no longer included in the PSDK package starting in 08.01.00 release.

TI Arm Clang C/C++ Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
08.01.00 was the first release which includes TI Arm Clang Compiler (tiarmclang) for the R5F cores. Prior
releases used the TI Arm Compiler (armcl).  There are migration steps that may be necessary for existing
code running on the R5F cores.  The software delivered on R5F from TI has aleady been migrated accordingly.
Please review the PDK release notes (|pdk_release_notes|) for additional links and developer pages dedicated
Clang migration.

Video Codecs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
RTOS based video codec support has been REMOVED from the PSDK RTOS starting in 08.00.00 release.  Codecs can be accessible
via Linux SDK, or by using PSDK RTOS 07.03.00.

TI-RTOS vs. FreeRTOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FreeRTOS is the default OS for R5F libraries and binaries starting in 08.00.00 release.  In 08.01.00 release,
FreeRTOS is the default build and TI-RTOS (Sysbios) is no longer supported or packaged as part of the SDK.
Please review the PDK release notes (|pdk_release_notes|) for additional links and developer pages dedicated
FreeRTOS migration.

Enet LLD
^^^^^^^^
Support for scatter-gather in packet transmission has been added starting in 08.05.00 release.  This feature
requires a change in Enet LLD DMA API, so applications using Enet LLD APIs need to be ported to use the updated
API.  Developers should refer to the porting steps documented in Enet LLD User's Guide (|enet_sg_porting_guide|).

NDK vs. lwIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^
lwIP is the default network stack starting in 08.00.00 release. In 08.01.00 release, NDK was no longer supported
or packaged as part of the SDK.

MCU Software (MCUSW)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ethernet
""""""""
MCAL Ethernet (MCU CPSW_2G) and Virtual MAC (virtual client for CPSW_9G) drivers have been signficantly
refactored to remove most dependencies with other SDK components, such as Enet LLD and UDMA LLD.
The only remaining SDK dependency is with SCI Client driver.  The driver configuration has also moved
to a static-oriented allocation approach for TX channel, RX channel, Ring Accs, and other resources.
Please refer to the Ethernet User Guide (|mcusw_eth_user_guide|) chapter in the MCUSW documentation
for further information about Ethernet module configuration.

Additionally, MCAL Ethernet driver (MCU CPSW_2G) now has Global Time support (packet timestamping) as well as
support for *link time* and *post-build* configuration, in addition to *pre-compile* variant already supported
in previous SDKs.
