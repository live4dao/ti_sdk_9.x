Upgrade and Compatibility
-------------------------
In this section, we only highlight a few significant changes in this SDK.  For full list of upgrade and
compatibility topics, please refer to individual components release notes :ref:`sdk_components`.

Video Codecs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
RTOS based video codec support has been REMOVED from the PSDK RTOS starting in 08.00.00 release.  Codecs can be accessible
via Linux SDK, or by using PSDK RTOS 07.03.00.

TI-RTOS vs. FreeRTOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While TI-RTOS (Sysbios) is still the OS supported on C6X and C7x DSPs, FreeRTOS is the default OS for R5F libraries and binaries
starting in 08.00.00 release.  In 08.01.00 release, FreeRTOS will be the default build for ALL R5F, C6x, and C7x DSPs,
and TI-RTOS (Sysbios) will no longer be supported or packaged as part of the SDK.

NDK vs. LwIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^
LwIP is the default network stack starting in 08.00.00 release for when FreeRTOS is running on R5F.  NDK is still packaged for if
TI-RTOS is enabled on R5F.  In 08.01.00 release, LwIP will be the default network stack for R5F and NDK will no longer be supported
or packaged as part of the SDK.

System Firmware Architecture Upgrade (PDK)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 7.1 release introduced the new architecture for System firmware where the TI Foundational Security (TIFS)
is running on the DMSC and Power Management & Resource Management (collectively known as Device Management (DM))
runs as a library on the MCU1_0 R5F. Refer to following pages for more details:

- :ref:`mcu1_0_app_with_sysfw` : Top-level SDK developer note
- |tisci_migration| : Specific details on SYSFW achitecture change in the PDK user guide

ENET LLD (PDK)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 7.1 release added Low-level driver support for CPSW Ethernet peripherals has been migrated from CPSW LLD to Enet LLD.  This change comes
with API name changes.  More details of this change can be found in the Upgrade and Compatibility section of the PDK

    ETHFW-795,[CPTS] GENF (and ESTF)  Reconfiguration Issue,"GENF/ESTF length values are read to check for earlier configuration. If already configured, current configuration is returned with a warning.",i2083
    PDK-4489,RAT : Error interrupt triggered even when error logging disable set, "If the RAT error logging is disabled, then the error interrupt should also be disabled by software.",i2062
    PDK-6894,DDR: Valid VRef range must be defined during LPDDR4 Command Bus Training,,i2160
    PDK-8226,R5FSS: The same interrupt cannot be nested back-2-back within another interrupt,"This can be achieved by reserving the highest priority level (Priority-0), and using that priority for a dummy interrupt (any one out of 512 interrupts available in R5), and calling this dummy interrupt inside every ISR. Further, the R5 core itself need not enter this dummy ISR (it can be masked), only the handshake with VIM around this dummy ISR needs to happen. This issue is addressed in J721E SR1.1.",i2162
    PDK-8375,OSPI Boot Mode Failure with MCU2_1 Core ,"STOG should be left in disabled/bypass mode. This issue is addressed in J721E SR1.1.",i2121
    PRSDK-6362,MMC: MMC1/2 Speed Issue,,i2090
    PRSDK-8660,VTM: Software reads from on-die Temperature Sensors can be corrupted,,i2053
    TIDL-523,C7x MMA HWA_STATUS reports errors before application starts,,i2087
    TIDL-533,"C7x: The C7x memory system and cpu may stall indefinitely, in the presence L1D snoops caused due to streaming engine reads, cache misses from MSMC or DDR, L1D victims, and some other specific conditions in a small time window.",,i2065
