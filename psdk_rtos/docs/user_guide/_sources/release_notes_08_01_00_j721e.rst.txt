Release notes - 08_01_00
========================

.. NOTE::

   08_01_00_12 release is a critical bug fix update from 08_01_00_11 from
   ti.com.  If you had previously downloaded 08_01_00_11, then the following
   is a list of bug fixes / changes from 08_01_00_11 (also reflected in specific component
   release notes):

   - **ADASVISION-5103: Random hang at vxWaitGraph for MCU2_0 based OpenVx nodes**

     - Enabled -fno-strict-aliasing clang compile flag in R5F builds.
   - **ADASVISION-4874: 8-camera use case fails with FreeRTOS**

     - Calling portTASK_USES_FLOATING_POINT() for all TIOVX and vision_apps tasks so that
       FPU registers are perserved during FreeRTOS conftext switch.  If custom tasks use floating
       point operation, then this call should also be added to beginning of custom tasks.
   - **ADASVISION-5116: QNX7: PSDK QNX 8.1 build error with imaging library**

     - Excluded imaging libraries not needed for QNX build from the QNX build.
   - **LCPD-24664: j721e-hsevm fails to boot**

     - Disable clang optimizer on boardcfgRmFindCertSize function of sciclient_direct.c file
       for R5F firmware image build.
   - **Update SDL to 0.2.0 release**


.. NOTE::

   If you are needing to use Linux SPL Uboot on an HS device, then please note
   that you will need to use updated DM firmware from this release.  Instructions
   can be found on the release download page.

Upgrade and Compatibility
-------------------------
In this section, we only highlight a few significant changes in this SDK.  For full list of upgrade and
compatibility topics, please refer to individual components release notes :ref:`sdk_components`.

Gateway Demos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Gateway Demos are no longer included in the PSDK package starting in 08.01.00 release.

TI Arm Clang C/C++ Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the first release which includes TI Arm Clang Compiler (tiarmclang) for the R5F cores. Prior
releases used the TI Arm Compiler (armcl).  There are migration steps that may be necessary for existing
code running on the R5F cores.  The software delivered on R5F from TI has aleady been migrated accordingly.
Please review the PDK release notes (|pdk_release_notes|) for additional links and developer pages dedicated
Clang migration.

Video Codecs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
RTOS based video codec support has been REMOVED from the PSDK RTOS starting in 08.00.00 release.  Codecs can be accessible
via Linux SDK, or by using PSDK RTOS 07.03.00.

TI-RTOS vs. FreeRTOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FreeRTOS is the default OS for R5F libraries and binaries starting in 08.00.00 release.  In 08.01.00 release,
FreeRTOS is the default build and TI-RTOS (Sysbios) is no longer supported or packaged as part of the SDK.
Please review the PDK release notes (|pdk_release_notes|) for additional links and developer pages dedicated
FreeRTOS migration.

NDK vs. LwIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^
LwIP is the default network stack starting in 08.00.00 release. In 08.01.00 release, NDK is no longer supported
or packaged as part of the SDK.

    ETHFW-795,[CPTS] GENF (and ESTF)  Reconfiguration Issue,"GENF/ESTF length values are read to check for earlier configuration. If already configured, current configuration is returned with a warning.",i2083
    PDK-4489,RAT : Error interrupt triggered even when error logging disable set, "If the RAT error logging is disabled, then the error interrupt should also be disabled by software.",i2062

    PDK-8226,R5FSS: The same interrupt cannot be nested back-2-back within another interrupt,"This can be achieved by reserving the highest priority level (Priority-0), and using that priority for a dummy interrupt (any one out of 512 interrupts available in R5), and calling this dummy interrupt inside every ISR. Further, the R5 core itself need not enter this dummy ISR (it can be masked), only the handshake with VIM around this dummy ISR needs to happen. This issue is addressed in J721E SR1.1.",i2162
