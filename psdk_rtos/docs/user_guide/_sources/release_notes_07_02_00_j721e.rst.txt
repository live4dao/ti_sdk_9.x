The previous (7.1) release introduced the new architecture for System firmware where the TI Foundational Security (TIFS)
is running on the DMSC and Power Management & Resource Management (collectively known as Device Management (DM))
runs as a library on the MCU1_0 R5F. Refer to following pages for more details:
