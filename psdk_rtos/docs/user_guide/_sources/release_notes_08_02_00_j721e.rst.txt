Upgrade and Compatibility
-------------------------
In this section, we only highlight a few significant changes in this SDK.  For full list of upgrade and
compatibility topics, please refer to individual components release notes :ref:`sdk_components`.

Gateway Demos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Gateway Demos are no longer included in the PSDK package starting in 08.01.00 release.

TI Arm Clang C/C++ Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
08.01.00 was the first release which includes TI Arm Clang Compiler (tiarmclang) for the R5F cores. Prior
releases used the TI Arm Compiler (armcl).  There are migration steps that may be necessary for existing
code running on the R5F cores.  The software delivered on R5F from TI has aleady been migrated accordingly.
Please review the PDK release notes (|pdk_release_notes|) for additional links and developer pages dedicated
Clang migration.

Video Codecs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
RTOS based video codec support has been REMOVED from the PSDK RTOS starting in 08.00.00 release.  Codecs can be accessible
via Linux SDK, or by using PSDK RTOS 07.03.00.

TI-RTOS vs. FreeRTOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FreeRTOS is the default OS for R5F libraries and binaries starting in 08.00.00 release.  In 08.01.00 release,
FreeRTOS is the default build and TI-RTOS (Sysbios) is no longer supported or packaged as part of the SDK.
Please review the PDK release notes (|pdk_release_notes|) for additional links and developer pages dedicated
FreeRTOS migration.

NDK vs. LwIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^
LwIP is the default network stack starting in 08.00.00 release. In 08.01.00 release, NDK was no longer supported
or packaged as part of the SDK.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Record ID", "Summary", "Workaround", "ErrataID"
   :widths: 20, 80, 60, 20

    ETHFW-795,[CPTS] GENF (and ESTF)  Reconfiguration Issue,"GENF/ESTF length values are read to check for earlier configuration. If already configured, current configuration is returned with a warning.",i2083
    PDK-4489,RAT : Error interrupt triggered even when error logging disable set, "If the RAT error logging is disabled, then the error interrupt should also be disabled by software.",i2062
    PDK-6894,DDR: Valid VRef range must be defined during LPDDR4 Command Bus Training,,i2160
    PDK-8226,R5FSS: The same interrupt cannot be nested back-2-back within another interrupt,"This can be achieved by reserving the highest priority level (Priority-0), and using that priority for a dummy interrupt (any one out of 512 interrupts available in R5), and calling this dummy interrupt inside every ISR. Further, the R5 core itself need not enter this dummy ISR (it can be masked), only the handshake with VIM around this dummy ISR needs to happen. This issue is addressed in J721E SR1.1.",i2162
    PDK-8375,OSPI Boot Mode Failure with MCU2_1 Core ,"STOG should be left in disabled/bypass mode. This issue is addressed in J721E SR1.1.",i2121
    PRSDK-6362,MMC: MMC1/2 Speed Issue,,i2090
    PRSDK-8660,VTM: Software reads from on-die Temperature Sensors can be corrupted,,i2053
    TIDL-523,C7x MMA HWA_STATUS reports errors before application starts,,i2087
    TIDL-533,"C7x: The C7x memory system and cpu may stall indefinitely, in the presence L1D snoops caused due to streaming engine reads, cache misses from MSMC or DDR, L1D victims, and some other specific conditions in a small time window.",,i2065
